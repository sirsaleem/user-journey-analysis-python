User Journey Analysis in Python
Overview
User Journey Analysis in Python is a robust data analysis project that delves into real-world data from 365's online subscription-based learning platform. The primary focus of this project is to develop powerful tools and functions in Python for analyzing the user journeys of different individuals on the platform. The term "user journey" refers to the sequence of pages each user visits before making a subscription purchase.

Understanding user behavior is critical for businesses as it allows them to identify key pages or sequences that drive conversions. This analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior, enabling businesses to optimize marketing campaigns and identify unnecessary pages in their platforms.

Key Features
Data Exploration and Cleaning: Load and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and outliers for accurate analysis.

User Journey Analysis: Develop functions to identify and analyze the sequences of pages visited by each user. Calculate the frequency of page visits and session durations.

Conversion Analysis: Identify pages where users convert to paying customers and calculate conversion rates based on user interactions.

User Behavior Insights: Explore common paths taken by users who converted versus those who did not. Analyze correlations between page visits and conversion.

Visualization: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations that depict user journeys, conversion rates, and other relevant metrics.

Tool Building: Create modular and reusable functions or classes for each analysis step. Optionally, build a user-friendly interface or dashboard for easy interaction.
